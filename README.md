Pixel Void is a simple project to create a web app that can remove background from images.
Upload an image and it will attempt to remove the background. You'll receive a preivew of the new image and a Download link. All images are automatically deleted within 15 minutes.

This tool was built using Flask, Python, and the REMBG library.
